        "Instruct": "What is planning phase in DevOps process model?",
        "Output": "The planning phase includes everything that happens before the actual development of the program code. The focus here is on a road map that is used to plan the implementation of changes to the product. These changes can be based on both user feedback as well as on in-house requirements. In a modern tool that is used to map the DevOps pipeline, these artifacts are then converted into epics, features, and user stories. In preparation of the next phase, sprints are then planned from these based on derived tasks. Tools for planning tasks include, for example, JIRA, Redmine, or EasyRedmine."
